## 📌 Types of System Design

### **1️⃣ High-Level Design (HLD)**
Focus: Overall architecture of the system.
Includes:
- System components & interactions  
- API gateways, load balancers  
- Microservices vs Monolith  
- Data flow diagrams  
- Scalability planning  

---

### **2️⃣ Low-Level Design (LLD)**
Focus: Implementation-level details.

Includes:
- Class diagrams & function logic  
- API structures & response formats  
- Database schema design  
- Design patterns (Factory, Singleton, Strategy)  

---

### **3️⃣ Component / Infrastructure Design**
Focus: Deployment & infrastructure decisions.

Includes:
- Cloud architecture (AWS, GCP, Azure)  
- CI/CD pipelines  
- Caching, sharding, replication  
- Queues, CDN, reverse proxies
