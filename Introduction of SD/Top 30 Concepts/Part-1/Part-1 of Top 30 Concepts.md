## **1. Client-Server Architecture**

Almost every web application that you use is built on this simple yet powerful concept called **client-server architecture**.

On one side, you have a **client**—this could be a web browser, a mobile app, or any other frontend application.
and on the other side, you have a **server**—a machine that runs continuously, waiting to handle incoming requests.
The client sends a request to **store, retrieve, or modify data**.
The server receives the request, processes it, performs the necessary operations, and sends back a response.
This sounds simple, but there’s a big question: _**How does the client even know where to find the server?**_
